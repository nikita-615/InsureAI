### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Google Gemini API key
- Tavily API key

### Create virtual environment
Before running the application, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. (Note: These are steps for venv in python , to create venv in conda there would be different steps.)
```
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

### Creating .env file
In the root directory of this repo, create a .env file and insert your secrets into the below:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY = "Your Gemini API Key"
TAVILY_API_KEY = "Your Tavily API key"
 ```

### Activate the virtual environment
```venv\Scripts\activate```

### Install dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### To run the final code
```streamlit run app.py```

### File description:
1. requirements.txt: contains all the dependencies.
2. app.py: final code to fetch results of the sql query by combining the api key, sql server, prompts, helper functions and the python function.
3. InsureClimateAI.pptx: A document that shows the outputs and reports generated by the application.
